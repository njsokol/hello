        <h2>Passions</h2>
        <p>Throughout my career I have found a passion through building web experiences. From the
        front end, to the backend, and design, to support/SRE, the lifecycle of a product is more
        than deliverables and deadlines. As an experience, we can find shared patterns,
        reusability, synchronization, and deeper meaning to our work and the interactions of customers.</p>
        <div class="quotes">
          <blockquote>"We reserve the right to get better."</blockquote>
          <p>We shouldn't count failure as a bad thing. We also shouldn't fill our packs so full we can't
          carry it. Get our designs/prototypes/mvps (whatever you want to call it) into the hands of
          real users and make decisions based off data.</p>
          <blockquote>"Design for users. Why anything else?"</blockquote>
          <p>Duh. If we aren't building a user-centric design - are we building for robots? Or do we
          just like the guessing game?</p>
          <blockquote>"Make things as small as they can be. Then make them bigger."</blockquote>
          <p>Iterate, iterate, iterate some more. Design is never done, and we shouldn't consider
          our products ever "fully complete". We should start small, fail fast, recovery even
          faster, and keep our debt in check.

        <h2>Craft</h2>
        <p>
          I am an active learner and find doing something the best way to understand it. I never
          stop exploring new technologies or walking different paths (why choose one?). I also enjoy
          pushing the boundaries of what is possible; that includes performance, IE support, and
          user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My greatest fear is that everything becomes the same. Once the robots take over, haha -
          <a href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="__blank">but seriously</a>, the web will
          become a less enjoyful experience. The web should be celebrated with new technologies,
          frameworks, themes, designs, and languages. It should be used for expression, like an
          artist, describing a history, legacy or future.

          Thank God for Blockbuster. Life moves at an incredibly fast pace. If we don't make the
          time to slow down once in a while and enjoy it and everything we have accomplished thus
          far - what are we doing? I enjoying learning about the web, and being half a ux designer.
          I don't see myself ever stopping, because I love to do it.
