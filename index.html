          I am an active learner and find doing something the best way to understand it. I never
          stop exploring new technologies or walking different paths (why choose one?). I also enjoy
          pushing the boundaries of what is possible; that includes performance, IE support, and
          user experience.

          My greatest fear is that everything becomes the same. Once the robots take over, haha -
          <a href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="__blank">but seriously</a>, the web will
          become a less enjoyful experience. The web should be celebrated with new technologies,
          frameworks, themes, designs, and languages. It should be used for expression, like an
          artist, describing a history, legacy or future.

          Thank God for Blockbuster. Life moves at an incredibly fast pace. If we don't make the
          time to slow down once in a while and enjoy it and everything we have accomplished thus
          far - what are we doing? I enjoying learning about the web, and being half a ux designer.
          I don't see myself ever stopping, because I love to do it.
